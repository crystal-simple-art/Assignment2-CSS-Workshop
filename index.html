            Mango Sago is a refreshing and satisfying summer dessert, with juicy chunks of mango and a mango/coconut milk tapioca pudding. Sweet, tangy and creamy, it's a summer dessert you'd want all year long!
            <br>
            <br>
            Mango sago is also quite healthy! If you wanted to make this vegan, you can simply replace the condensed milk with simple syrup or agave.

      <h2 class="brown2">About Mango Sago</h2>
      <p class="introduction">
        Mango sago (杨枝甘露) is an adaptation of a traditional Asian dessert invented by a Hongkong restaurant in the early 1980's which has grown in popularity across the globe and can now be found on the menu list of most Chinese restaurants. Along with the mango pudding and tapioca pearls, the original Hongkong version includes pomelo sections which you can definitely add in if you prefer another layer of flavor and texture.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is for sure one of the easiest and simplest desserts you can make. It only needs five ingredients and is convenient for serving a crowd as it can be prepped ahead of time. In fact, it tastes so much better when chilled for a few hours and the flavors had a chance to meld.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you like your Mango Sago cold, chill the mango mixture for an hour before adding the tapioca. Just keep in mind that colder temperatures reduce the sweetness, so you may need to add more condensed milk to taste if serving this very cold.
        <br>
        <br>
        I personally like to use slightly underripe mangoes (already yellow but still very firm) as I find the extra hint of tartness makes the mango sago more refreshing but feel free to use very ripe mangoes or add more sugar if you want something a little sweeter.
        Although you can use just about any type of mango, I suggest picking ones that have a smooth flesh and have no fibers like our Manila Mangoes or Ataulfo.

        <h4> Step 1:</h4>
        <p class="instructiontext">In a pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the mini pearl tapioca (don’t add it before the water is at a full boil!). Stir and bring it to boil again. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the tapioca is completely transparent, which means they’re fully cooked. (A common mistake is to take them off the heat while they still have a small white dot at the center. They should be completely translucent.)

        <h4> Step 2:</h4>
        <p class="instructiontext">When the tapioca is cooked through, drain, rinse in cold water to cool, then soak in a bowl of cold water and set aside.

        <h4> Step 3:</h4>
        <p class="instructiontext">Meanwhile, peel the mango, trimming to remove the center pit. Set aside a large handful of nice chunks for topping. The rest will be blended.

        <h4> Step 4:</h4>
        <p class="instructiontext">In a blender, add the coconut milk, condensed milk, vanilla extract, and mango. Blend until smooth, and transfer to a large bowl. At this stage, if you like your dessert cold, chill the mango mixture for at least an hour before adding the tapioca.
